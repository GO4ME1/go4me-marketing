    {
      question: "How does Go4me.ai work?",
      answer: "Go4me.ai connects you with vetted local agents (we call them gophers) who complete real-world tasks on your behalf. Simply describe your task, and we'll dispatch an agent to handle it. You get SMS updates and photo/receipt proof when it's done."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost?",
      answer: "Pricing varies by service. Each task has a flat service fee, and for purchases (like In-N-Out or DMV fees), we place a temporary hold on your card. We only charge the exact amount shown on receipts, and unused funds are released automatically within 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "What areas do you serve?",
      answer: "We're currently live in San Diego. Los Angeles and San Francisco are launching within 2 weeks. Join our waitlist to be notified when we launch in your city."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can tasks be completed?",
      answer: "Most tasks are completed same-day, often within 2-4 hours. In-N-Out runs typically take 30-45 minutes. DMV visits depend on wait times but are usually done within a few hours. Eyes On visits are typically completed within 2-4 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "Are your agents background-checked?",
      answer: "Yes! Every agent goes through a comprehensive background check before joining our network. We verify identity, driving records, and criminal history to ensure your safety and peace of mind."
    },
    {
      question: "What if something goes wrong?",
      answer: "We provide photo and receipt proof for every task. If there's an issue, contact us immediately at support@go4me.ai. We'll investigate and make it right. Agents are insured while on active tasks through our platform."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I track my task?",
      answer: "You'll receive SMS updates at key milestones: when an agent accepts, when they arrive, during the task, and when it's completed. You'll also get photo proof and receipts delivered via text or email."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I request a specific agent?",
      answer: "Not yet, but we're working on a favorites feature. For now, tasks are broadcast to available agents in your area, and the first to accept gets the job."
    },
    {
      question: "What tasks won't you do?",
      answer: "We cannot handle: prescription medications, controlled substances, alcohol or tobacco (age-restricted), hazardous materials, weapons, anything illegal or unethical, or tasks requiring professional licensing (legal, medical, etc.)."
    },
    {
      question: "How do refunds work?",
      answer: "If no agent accepts your task within the SLA (Service Level Agreement), we automatically refund your service fee and void any deposit holds. If a task is cancelled after acceptance, refund eligibility depends on the circumstancesâ€”contact support for assistance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I tip my agent?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Tips are appreciated and go 100% to your agent. You can add a tip when the task is completed through the confirmation message."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer business accounts?",
      answer: "Yes! We have special pricing and features for law firms, auto dealers, property managers, and other businesses. Visit our Business page or email support@go4me.ai to learn more about our 2-week free pilot program."
